# Values given
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3

# Here is the formula for the calculation.
Interest = principal * rate * time

# printing the values given in words
print(f"For principal = {principal}, Rate = {rate}, and Time = {time},")
# The final answer
print(f"The simple interest is {float(Interest)}")
